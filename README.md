# Backend_Challenge
This repository contains an efficient Greedy algorithm solution for the Task Scheduler (LeetCode 621) problem. The approach uses frequency counting and scheduling optimization to compute the minimum time required to execute all tasks while respecting cooldown constraints. The solution is optimized for time and space
